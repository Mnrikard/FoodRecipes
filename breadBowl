• 1 1/2 cups warm water

• 3/4 tablespoon instant yeast

• 2 tablespoons sugar

• 2 tablespoons oil

• 1 teaspoon salt

• 4 cups bread flour (more or less as needed

MIX. In a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer, mix together the warm water, yeast, sugar, oil, salt, and 2 cups of flour. Add the remaining flour, ½ cup at a time, until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and is smooth, but still slightly tacky.

KNEAD & RISE. Knead the dough until smooth and elastic. Place in a greased bowl, cover, and light rise until doubled (about one hour).

FORM. Gently punch down the dough and divide into six equal pieces. Roll each piece of dough into a ball and place on a greased or parchment lined baking sheet. Cut an x in the top of each dough ball.

RISE & PREP. Cover lightly with a kitchen towel and let rise until doubled, about 30-45 minutes. During the last 15 minutes of rise time, preheat the oven to 400.

BAKE. Bake 15 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through. Remove to a cooling rack to cool completely.

SERVE. To serve, cut a circle out of the top of the bread bowl, then scoop out the inside of the bread to make a bowl.  Ladle hot soup into the bowl and serve immediately.
