Directionss
• In a large skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Add onion and sausage; cook until sausage is lightly browned. Add garlic and cook 1 minute longer; transfer to a 5-qt. slow cooker.
• Stir in 4 cups broth, rice, salt and pepper. Cook, covered, on low until rice is tender, 4-5 hours. Stir in chicken and remaining broth. Cook, covered, on low until chicken is heated through, about 30 minutes. If desired, sprinkle with green onions. Serve with hot sauce.
• Freeze option: Omitting green onions and hot sauce, freeze cooled meat mixture, juices and rice in freezer containers. To use, partially thaw in refrigerator overnight. Microwave, covered, on high until heated through, stirring gently; add broth or water if necessary.
